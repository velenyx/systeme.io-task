# Systeme.io Task - Table component

Dive into the beauty of custom UI components with our NextJS Custom Table Component! This project leverages the power of NextJS, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript to deliver a sleek, scalable table component inspired by Tanstack Table, without using any external libraries. Our focus is on craftsmanship and detailed custom functionality.

## üîç Features:

- Dynamic Data Types: Handle hundreds of different data types seamlessly. Initially set up with three categories: Products, Price Plans, and Pages, each on its own page.
- Reusable Table Component: A highly reusable and customizable table component used across different pages.
- Customizable Cells and Headers: Render cells and headers using any JSX element, allowing for rich content and customization.
- Interactive Editing: Update text fields directly within a modal dialog, and see changes instantly reflected in the table.
- Scalable Architecture: Built with TypeScript to ensure type safety and scalability.

## üõ† Tech Stack:

- NextJS: For robust server-side rendering and static generation.
- TailwindCSS: For stylish, responsive design without the bloat.
- TypeScript: For type safety and scalable application development.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
